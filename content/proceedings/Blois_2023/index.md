abstract: The analysis and the interpretation of the LHC data require a precise determination of Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) in order to detect reliably potential signs of new physics. I present a systematic study designed to assess the risk of absorbing, and thus missing, signals from heavy new physics in the PDFs parameterisation during the High-Luminosity LHC run. I discuss the consequences of such a PDF ”contamination” and consider possible solutions to it, for example the inclusion of other experimental data probing large-x regions at low-energy.
